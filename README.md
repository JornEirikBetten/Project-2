# Project-2
Contains all code and some data from Project 2, in the course FYS4150. <br>
The code solves an eigenvalue problem using Jacobi's rotational algorithm. <br> 


# Run code
To run the code, clone repository, cd to this directory and type "make" in terminal. <br>
Then type ./jacobisolver "Number for N". <br>
To run the code for problem 3, cd to this repository and type "make -f makefileprob3" and <br>
then run ./prob3 to get output in terminal. <br>
To run prob4b.cpp, type make -f makefileprob4b in terminal, and run ./prob4b. <br>
To run prob5b.cpp, type make -f makefileprob5b in terminal, and run ./prob5b. <br>
As for pythonscripts:  <br>
cd to this directory <br>
python3 "name of pythonscript".py <br>
To run pythonread.py, you first have to run ./jacobisolver 10 and ./jacobisolver 100.
